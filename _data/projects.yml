    This project was born out of floppy strings and typos. In a nutshell, this tool is a down and dirty way to have strongly typed Config Settings and Connection Strings in your projects by using T4 templates.

    Created this little gem while building a client side UI that served as the frontend of a service oriented architecture. At the time we were using Particular's NService Bus and we needed a way to create sequential unique identifiers on the client. 
    
    This was also a fun little jaunt in creating and publishing npm packages, like we needed another one...  (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscombguid">npm jscombguid</a>)
